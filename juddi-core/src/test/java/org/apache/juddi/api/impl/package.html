<p>Unit tests to test the api implementation. Theses tests go all the way down into
the persistence layer. By default they are using an embedded Java-based database
called Derby. </p>

<p>The order in which the tests are run is irrelevant however some tests are more basic
then others. For example, you will need to have a Publisher, before you can persist
a Business, and you need to have a Business before you can persist a Service. So it
makes sense to test persisting a Publisher first.</p>

<p>By default JUnit executes tests in alphabetical order, so to control test execution order we
use the JUDDI_###_ prefix.
