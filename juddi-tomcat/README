Please use maven-2.2.1 or newer when building, 

juddi-tomcat uses dependency properties which are broken in recent versions of maven.

You will see an error like:

Caused by: java.io.FileNotFoundException: 
C:\development\projects\jUDDI_v3\juddi-tomcat\${maven.dependency.tomcat.apache-tomcat.zip.path} 
(The system cannot find the file specified)

where the ${maven.dependency.tomcat.apache-tomcat.zip.path} should have been set by maven.
