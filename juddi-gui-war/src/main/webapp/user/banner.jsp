Hello World!

If you want to really customize your juddi-gui instance, feel free to edit this file.
You can use it to append html, javascript or whatever else you want onto every visible
page of the juddi-gui. 

Often companies and government agencies need to insert banners, warnings or 
classification information on their web sites. This can be used to insert it
painlessly. enjoy
