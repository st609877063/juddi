</span></span><b><i>completionStatus</i></b>: This optional argument lets the
publisher restrict the result set to only those relationships that have the
specified status value.&nbsp; Assertion status is a calculated result based on the
sum total of assertions made by the individuals that control specific business
registrations.&nbsp; When no completionStatus element is provided, all assertions
involving the businesses that the publisher owns are retrieved, without regard
to the completeness of the relationship.&nbsp; completionStatus MUST contain one of
the following values</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:1.5in;text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">o<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>status:complete</b>: Passing this value causes only the
publisher assertions that are complete to be returned.&nbsp; Each businessEntity
listed in assertions that are complete has a visible relationship that directly
reflects the data in a complete assertion (as described in the
find_relatedBusinesses API).</p>

those publisher assertions where the party who controls the businessEntity
referenced by the toKey value in an assertion, has not made a matching
assertion, to be listed.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:1.5in;text-indent:-.25in"><span style="font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">o<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b>status:fromKey_incomplete</b>: Passing this value causes only
those publisher assertions where the party who controls the businessEntity
referenced by the fromKey value in an assertion, has not made a matching
assertion, to be listed.</p>

</span></span><b>status:both_incomplete</b>. This status value, however, is only
applicable to the context of UDDI subscription and SHOULD not be present as
part of a response to a get_assertionStatusReport request.</p>
