 *
 * <p class="MsoBodyText">To ensure that publisher-generated keys do not

 * to publishers in the following manner:</p>

 * <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in">1.<span
 * style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New

 * style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New
 * Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The publisher with

 * registry itself has authority for the root partition of the hierarchy.</p>
 *
 * <p class="MsoBodyText">The specific mechanisms that enforce these rules are
 * explained below.</p>
 *
 * <p class="MsoBodyText">Each node of a registry is a generator of keys.&nbsp;
 * This is required to enable the node to generate keys not provided by
 * publishers. In addition, the policies of a registry MAY allow individual
 * publishers to obtain the authority to be generators of keys for specific
 * partitions within the space of uddiKeys. Publishers obtain this authority by
 * owning a particular tModel called a key generator tModel.&nbsp; The key
 * generator tModel contains a key generator key, and it specifies the partition
 * for which the publisher may assign keys.&nbsp; </p>
 *
 * <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="layout-grid-mode:line">The subset of

 *
 * <p class="MsoBodyText">As described in Section 4.4.1, a derivedKey is one
 * that is formed from another key by appending a non-empty, colon-prefixed
 * string to another uddiKey.&nbsp; A derivedKey is said to be "based on" this
 * uddiKey. With this in mind, the complete partition of a given keyGeneratorKey
 * is the set of keys consisting of:</p>

 *
 * <p class="MsoBodyText">A rootKeyGeneratorKey is a keyGeneratorKey that is not

 * <h5 style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">5.2.2.1.1 Examples</h5>
 *
 * <p class="MsoBodyText">Based on the rules above, it is possible to construct
 * the keyGeneratorKey for any key by manipulating the string representation of
 * the key. To illustrate, suppose the key is x, then the following pseudo-code
 * will determine the keyGeneratoryKey:</p>
 *
 * <p class="codeSample">If x is a keyGeneratorKey, and y is that key minus the
 * ":keygenerator" suffix,</p>

 * <p class="codeSample">&nbsp;&nbsp; else y is a derivedKey, based on z, </p>
 *
 * <p class="codeSample">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and xâ€™s

 * Behavior of publishers</a></h4>
 *
 * <p class="MsoBodyText">To successfully publish a new entity with a proposed
 * key, the publisher needs to own the key generator tModel for the partition in
 * which the key lies. Typically, a publisher gets ownership by publishing the
 * tModel in question, but publishers can also get ownership in other ways, for
 * example by having another publisher transfer ownership.</p>
 *
 * <p class="MsoBodyText">Once a publisher owns a key generator tModel that
 * publisher MAY publish new entities<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20"
 * title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span
 * class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span
 * style="font-size:10.0pt;letter-spacing:-.25pt">[20]</span></span></span></a>
 * and assign them keys within the key generator tModelâ€™s partition. New keys
 * can only be generated from keyGenerator tModels that are not hidden.
 * Publishers are responsible for managing the uniqueness of the keys in the
 * partition they own. If a publisher fails to do so, and generates an already
 * used key, a publish operation could inadvertently replace an entity
 * previously published by that publisher.</p>
 *
 * <p class="MsoBodyText">If a publisher owns key generator tModels with the
 * same key in multiple registries â€“ for example one in the publisherâ€™s private
 * test registry and one in the UDDI Business Registry â€“ that publisher MAY
 * publish the entities with identical keys in those registries. This enables
 * many interesting capabilities. For example, publishers may choose to develop
 * their UDDI entities by publishing them into test registries and then, at
 * appropriate times, "promote" them to the UDDI Business Registry.</p>

 *
 * <p class="MsoBodyText">During a publish operation, the entity or entities

 * be the "root registry" and assigning it to be the authority for the root
 * partition. Other registries in the set are said to be affiliate
 * registries.&nbsp; See Section <a href="#_Ref11678674 ">1.5.5</a>
 * &nbsp;<i>Affiliations of Registries</i> for more information</p>
 *
 * <p class="MsoBodyText">The UDDI Business Registry is a root registry. Its
 * policies and procedures are designed to make it simple for any UDDI registry
 * to be affiliated with it.</p>
 *
 * <p class="MsoBodyText">Designating new authorities is done by publishing key
 * generator tModels in the root registry, in one or more of the registries
 * affiliated with the root registry or both. The owner of a key generator
 * tModel is the naming authority for the partition the tModel represents. </p>

 * for validated value sets</a></h3>
 *
 * <p class="MsoBodyText">Several of the APIs defined in this section allow
 * publishers to save category and identifier information in support of searches
 * that use category and identifier system references.&nbsp; The save_business,
 * save_service, save_binding and save_tModel APIs allow designation of these
 * value set references.&nbsp; Categorization is specified using the element
 * named categoryBag, which contains namespace-qualified references to
 * categories and descriptions.&nbsp; categoryBags can also contain groups of
 * these references to categories and descriptions.&nbsp; Identifiers are
 * specified using the identifierBag element, which contains namespace-qualified
 * references to identifiers and descriptions.</p>
 *
 * <p class="MsoBodyText">Similarly, the add_publisherAssertions and
 * set_publisherAssertions APIs allow publisherAssertion elements to be
 * saved.&nbsp; These publisherAssertion elements contain a characterization of
 * the relationship being established using a keyedReference element that refers
 * to a relationship type system.</p>
 *
 * <p class="MsoBodyText">Identifier, category and relationship type systems
 * taken together are referred to as "value sets."&nbsp; UDDI allows value sets
 * to be checked or unchecked.&nbsp; References to checked value sets that are
 * registered in UDDI can be checked internally by the UDDI nodes where
 * publishing takes place, or externally by a provider of a validation Web
 * service.&nbsp; The UDDI node can also choose to not support some or all
 * checked value sets.</p>
 *
 * <p class="MsoBodyText">When a UDDI node encounters a reference to a checked
 * value set in a keyedReference it will either ensure the reference is
 * validated or fail the save.&nbsp; Such references to supported checked value
 * sets are verified for validity according to the validation algorithm defined
 * for the value set and described by its tModel.&nbsp; When all checks succeed,
 * the save is permitted.&nbsp; An E_unvalidatable error indicates the checked
 * value set is supported but its validation algorithm is not available.&nbsp;
 * An E_unsupported indicates the checked value set is not supported by the
 * node. &nbsp;E_invalidValue or E_valueNotAllowed indicate one or more
 * references failed validation.&nbsp; When the checked value set is not
 * supported, the value setâ€™s validation algorithm is unavailable, or any of the
 * references fail validation, the save operation MUST fail. </p>
 *
 * <p class="MsoBodyText">When the UDDI node supports a checked value set it may
 * check the references itself, or consult a validation Web service.&nbsp; For
 * cached checked value sets, the UDDI node verifies that referenced keyValues
 * are in the set of valid values for the value set.&nbsp; The selection of an
 * algorithm for verifying a checked value set is a matter of registry policy as
 * detailed in Chapter <a href="#_Ref8980043 ">9</a> <i>Policy</i>.</p>
 *
 * <p class="MsoBodyText">A category group system is portrayed by a
 * keyedRefererenceGroup element.&nbsp; Each keyedReferenceGroup has a tModelKey
 * that references the category group system, and a set of contained
 * keyedReference elements that make up the actual group of categories.&nbsp;
 * Similar to references to checked value sets, validation is carried out for a
 * keyedReferenceGroup if the referenced category group system is checked.&nbsp;
 * Such validation entails verification that the keyedReferenceGroup is valid
 * according to the validation algorithm described by the tModel for the
 * category group system.&nbsp; Validation for a keyedReferenceGroup that
 * references a cached checked category group system involves verification that
 * the tModels referenced by the contained keyedReference elements are valid for
 * the category group system.&nbsp; The set of valid values for such a cacheable
 * checked category group system is defined by the tModelKeys for the set of
 * tModels that can participate in the group.</p>
 *
 * <p class="MsoBodyText">No validation is performed on references to unchecked
 * value sets</p>

 *
 * <p class="MsoBodyText">During save_xx API calls, the name, description,

 *
 * <p class="MsoBodyText">Name elements in UDDI core data structures are
 * frequently the main targets for sorts during UDDI inquiries.&nbsp; When a
 * UDDI data structure has multiple names, sorting occurs on the first

 * entity is saved to ensure the proper placement of the entity in a sorted
 * result set.</p>
 *
 * <p class="MsoBodyText">Values which can be passed in the language supplied in

<p class="MsoBodyText">When a publisherAssertion that is being saved references a
checked relationship system using the tModelKey in the contained
keyedReference, the reference MUST be checked for validity prior to completion
of the save, or the node must return E_unsupported, indicating it does not
support the referenced checked relationship system.&nbsp; Validation of a
relationship system reference entails verification that the reference is valid
according to the validation algorithm defined for the relationship system and
described by its tModel.&nbsp; For cached checked relationship system, the
validation algorithm verifies that referenced keyedReferences are valid for the
relationship system.</p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">For registries supporting the subscription APIs at any
node, it is necessary to track a modified date for publisherAssertion elements
so that nodes have the necessary information for responding to subscription
requests involving find_relatedBusinesses and get_assertionStatusReport
filters.</p>

* <p class="MsoBodyText">Upon successful completion, a publisherAssertions
structure is returned containing all of the relationship assertions currently
attributed to the publisher.&nbsp; When registries distinguish between publishers,
the structure contains assertion data that is associated with the authInfo
passed.</p>
