/**
 * This portType defines all of the UDDI custody transfer operations. This
 * section defines the UDDI Custody and Ownership Transfer API Set[28]. Data
 * custody is introduced in Section 1.5.6 Data Custody. Ownership transfer is
 * introduced in Section 1.5.7 Transfer of Ownership. By virtue of having
 * created an entity, a publisher has ownership of the entity and is said to be
 * the owner of the entity. A custodial node MUST maintain a relationship of
 * ownership between an entity and its publisher by means of authorization
 * mechanisms. Every node of a multi-node registry MUST guarantee the integrity
 * of an entity's custody. As such, a node MUST not permit changes to an entity
 * unless it has custody of it.
 *
 * The Custody and Ownership Transfer API Set enables any nodes of a registry to
 * cooperatively transfer custody of one or more businessEntity or tModel
 * structures from one node to another, as well as allowing the transfer of
 * ownership of these structures from one publisher to another. Associated
 * entities of a businessEntity such as its businessService, bindingTemplate,
 * and publisherAssertion structures are transferred as part of the custody
 * transfer of the business entity. * From a custody transfer point of view, the
 * publishers are always distinct, though it may be the case that the publishers
 * are the same person. Also, the two nodes may or may not be distinct;
 * intra-node transfer between two publishers is simply a degenerate case in
 * which node custody does not change. Thus, in the case of an inter-node
 * transfer, ownership transfer is implied. In the case of an intra-node
 * transfer the behavior results in the transfer of ownership between two
 * publishers.
 *
 * For example, one UDDI registry, UDDI-1, MAY allow each node in UDDI-1
 * (composed of nodes 1A, 1B and 1C) to define its own policies for
 * registration, authentication and authorization. In this case, a "person",
 * (P1) would need to review the policies of all 3 nodes and decide upon the
 * node with which it chooses to register with. P1 may choose to register with
 * more than one node. P1 registers with node1A . Node1A also specifies how P1
 * is authenticated. If P1 successfully authenticates and publishes a business
 * entity (BE1) then P1 becomes the "owner" of BE1. Node1A is said to be the
 * "custodian" of BE1. P1 can also register at node1B. If P1 successfully
 * authenticates and publishes a business entity (BE2) then P1 becomes the
 * "owner" of BE2. Node1B is said to be the "custodian" of BE2. There is no
 * assumption that the registry UDDI-1 or its nodes (node1A and node1B) are
 * aware that P1 is the same "person". P1 is responsible for maintaining the
 * appropriate identity and authenticating correctly to each node within a
 * registry.
 *
 * Another UDDI registry, UDDI-2, MAY require each of its nodes (node2-1,
 * node2-2 and node2-3) to use the same registration, authentication and
 * authorization mechanisms. In this case, the policies are the same across all
 * nodes. The relationship of registration, publication and ownership remains
 * the same. If P1 wants to register with different nodes in UDDI-2, then it
 * needs to differentiate its registration with the different nodes, since an
 * attempt to register at node2-2 after registering at node2-1, would fail as
 * "already registered" (since by policy the nodes all share the same
 * registration, authentication and authorization).
 *
 * 5.4.1 Overview There are a number of scenarios where a publisher may choose
 * to transfer custodianship or ownership of one or more entities. These are
 * described in this section.
 *
 * 5.4.1.1 Intra-Node Ownership Transfer Intra-node ownership transfer involves
 * transferring entity ownership from one publisher to another within the same
 * UDDI node. Usage scenarios for this type of transfer include the following:
 *
 * · Businesses or organizational merges: Multiple organizations need to be
 * consolidated under the control of a single publisher.
 *
 * · Domain key generators: One use of ownership transfer is the transfer of
 * ownership of a derived key generator from one publisher to another to enable
 * her or him to publish entities using keys in that domain.
 *
 * The save_xx APIs can also be used to move entities between parent entities
 * that are owned by the same publisher. The save_service API, for example, can
 * be used to move services (and binding templates) between one business entity
 * and another as described in Section 5.2.17.3 Behavior of the save_service
 * API. Changing the parent relationship in this way causes two businessEntity
 * structures to be changed. Doing so enables the following scenarios:
 *
 * · Divestitures: An organization needs to reassign the control of a set of
 * services to two or more publishers.
 *
 * · Consolidation of registry entities: There are multiple entities for a given
 * business that are to be consolidated under a single publisher.
 *
 * 5.4.1.2 Inter-Node Custody Transfer Inter-node custody transfer involves the
 * custody transfer of a set of entities across nodes of a UDDI registry. A
 * transfer of ownership ensues as a consequence of this custody transfer. In
 * addition to the intra-node scenarios described above, inter-node custody
 * transfer may be used to address the following use cases:
 *
 * · Unsatisfactory service level: The functionality or service level provided
 * by a given node operator is insufficient, and the publisher wishes to move
 * their UDDI data to another node.
 *
 * · Change in availability for a UDDI node: A node is no longer providing UDDI
 * services, and all publishers need to be migrated to one or more nodes of the
 * registry.
 *
 * · Organizational Mergers, Divestitures or Consolidations: Changes in
 * organizational structure may result in the need to make changes to the set of
 * publishers used to manage the entities at various nodes of a registry.
 *
 * For any of these intra and inter-node scenarios, a mechanism is specified to
 * facilitate the transfer the custody of businessEntity and tModel entities
 * between nodes whether the entity is being transferred within a single node or
 * whether a custody transfer occurs between nodes of a registry.
 *
 * 5.4.2 Custody Transfer Considerations When a businessEntity is transferred,
 * all related businessService and bindingTemplate elements are transferred as
 * well. In addition, any publisherAssertion elements that reference the
 * businessEntity element’s businessKey that are owned by the publisher are also
 * transferred.
 *
 * Note that the relinquishing publisher is not required to transfer all of its
 * UDDI entities (i.e. businessEntity and/or tModel entities) in a single
 * custody transfer request, nor is it required to transfer all of its entities
 * to the same target publisher or target node. Any combination or subset of
 * UDDI registry entities may be transferred to any number of target publishers
 * or nodes.
 *
 * 5.4.3 Transfer Execution The Custody and Ownership Transfer API Set enables
 * two publishers P1 and P2 and two nodes, N1 and N2, in a registry to
 * cooperatively transfer custody of one or more existing businessEntity or
 * tModel structures, E1…En, from N1 to N2 and, and by extension to transfer
 * ownership of the entities from P1 to P2. Related businessService,
 * bindingTemplate, and publisherAssertion structures are transferred with their
 * related businessEntities. From the registry’s point of view, the publishers
 * are always distinct, though it may be the case that P1 and P2 are the same
 * party. The two nodes may or may not be distinct; intra-node transfer of
 * ownership from P1 to P2 is simply a degenerate case in which node custody
 * does not change.
 *
 * The Custody and Ownership Transfer API Set is divided into two parts, a set
 * of two client APIs and a single inter-node API. These client APIs are
 * get_transferToken and transfer_entities; in short, this constitutes the
 * Ownership Transfer API portion of this API set. The inter-node-API is
 * transfer_ custody which when combined with replication makes up the Custody
 * Transfer API portion of this API set. * The overall flow of custody and
 * ownership transfer is as follows:
 *
 * Publisher P1 invokes get_transferToken on N1, specifying the keys K1…Kn of
 * the entities E1…En that are to be transferred. If P1 is authorized to do this
 * (i.e., if P1 has ownership of E1…En), N1 returns a structure T, called a
 * transfer token, that represents authority to transfer the entities, including
 * all of the naturally contained children and publisher assertions related to
 * business entities involved in the transfer that are owned by P1. The
 * transferToken is a structure that consists of an opaque string that is
 * meaningful only to the node that issued it, an expiration time, and a node
 * identifier.
 *
 * P1 then gives T to P2 (typically by some secure means since T is valuable).
 * The publisher obtaining the custody information needs to have previously
 * obtained a publishers account on the node accepting custody of the entity
 * before he/she can complete the custody transfer. P2 then invokes
 * transfer_entities on N2, passing K1…Kn and T. If transfer_entities completes
 * successfully, the entities E1…En and their related structures
 * (businessService, bindingTemplate, and publisherAssertion) are in the custody
 * of N2 and are owned by P2. If the operation fails, nothing happens to the
 * entities. The actual transfer proceeds as follows, in the processing of
 * transfer_entities.
 *
 * If N1 and N2 are not distinct nodes, the ownership transfer from P1 to P2 is
 * an operation that is purely internal to the node – how it happens is up to
 * the implementation. If N1 and N2 are distinct, the following protocol occurs
 * while processing the transfer_entities request on N2.
 *
 * Upon receipt of a transfer_entities request, N2 checks that K1…Kn are valid
 * keys. There is the possibility that P1 might transfer more data than P2 can
 * accept due to policy-based restrictions on the limit of entities allowed to
 * be owned by P2 at N2. As is described below, replication is used to complete
 * the custody transfer process. A question that arises is at the time of
 * accepting the datum related to the transfer, could N2 throw a replication
 * error because the data being transferred exceeds the limits of user P2? Such
 * limits can not be enforced during replication because they are node-local
 * policy decisions from the perspective of enforcement. Thus, it is therefore
 * possible that as a result of a custody transfer a publisher may be caused to
 * hold more data that he/she would have been able to publish. Should this
 * situation occur, P2 MUST not be allowed to publish any additional data unless
 * P2 first reduces the number of entries it owns to an allowable limit.
 *
 * If all is well, N2 invokes the inter-node API transfer_custody on N1,
 * presenting the keys of top-level entities to be transferred, K1…Kn, P2’s
 * identity (using the publisher’s authorizedName), N2’s node identifier (as
 * known in the Replication Configuration structure, see Section 7.5.2
 * Configuration of a UDDI Node – operator element), and T. The transferToken,
 * T, implies permission to transfer the entire content of the entities it
 * identifies, including all of the contained entities and related
 * publisherAssertions, if any. N1 checks to see whether T is a valid
 * transferToken that it issued and that T represents the authority to transfer
 * E1…En. If the validation is successful, N1 prevents further changes to
 * entities E1…En. N1 then updates the authorizedName and nodeID of the
 * operationalInfo of E1…En and related entities so that they are shown to be in
 * the custody of N2 and owned by P2. Finally, N1 responds to N2 which triggers
 * N2 to respond to the transfer_entities caller. This completes the processing
 * for the transfer_entities request.
 *
 * In the case that the datum being transferred is a key generator tModel, N1
 * will disallow further generation of keys associated with this key partition
 * at its node.
 *
 * Following the issue of the empty message by N1 to the transfer_custody call,
 * N1 will submit into the replication stream a changeRecordNewData providing in
 * the operationalInfo, N2’s nodeID identifying it as the node where the datum
 * is being transferred to, and the authorizedName of P2. The
 * acknowledgmentRequested attribute of this change record MUST be set to
 * "true".
 *
 * The last modified date timestamp in the operationalInfo must change to
 * reflect the custody transfer. Figure 2 depicts the flow of a custody transfer
 * between P1 and P2. This class was generated by the JAX-WS RI. JAX-WS RI
 * 2.1.5-b03- Generated source version: 2.1
