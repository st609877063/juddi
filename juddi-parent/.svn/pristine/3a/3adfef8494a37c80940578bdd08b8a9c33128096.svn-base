 <!-- 
  This file contains the root business entity structure that represents your registry.  The key chosen (or generated) for this entity will serve
  as the node id for all entities published within the registry.  The services contained within this business entity reflect the UDDI APIs that
  you wish to support (adding or subtracting the services here will not enable/disable them, simply add/omit them from being discovered via UDDI).
  
  The top-level business entity and sub-entities all use keys as unique identifiers.  They are left blank by default which means the system will
  generate a key (generated as root partition with GUID appended).  You can choose to create your own, human-readable keys but they must match
  the root key generator created in the root_tModelKeyGen.xml file.  Matching means they must equal the root key generator with the keyword
  "keygenerator" replaced by your own string.
  
  Example:
  
  root_tModelKeyGen.xml key is uddi:www.mycompany.com:registry:keygenerator
  
  Legal user-defined keys are:
  
  uddi:www.mycompany.com:registry:ubr-node (for the businessKey)
  uddi:www.mycompany.com:registry:inquiry-service (for the inquiry service service key)
  uddi:www.mycompany.com:registry:inquiry-service-wsdlDeployment (for the inquiry service binding template that represents the WSDL)
